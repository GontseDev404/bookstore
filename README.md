## üåê Live Cloud Deployment
- **Live URL:** [https://bookhaven-app--b5bhqv6.victoriouspond-e9b4a388.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/](https://bookhaven-app--b5bhqv6.victoriouspond-e9b4a388.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/)
- **Platform:** Azure Container Apps

### Redeployment Steps
1. Push to the `main` branch on GitHub, or
2. Manually run the `Deploy to Azure Container Apps` workflow in GitHub Actions
   - This will build, push, and deploy the latest Docker image automatically 

## Testing

### Unit & Integration Tests (Jest)
- Run all non-database tests:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Jest is configured to ignore E2E tests in the `e2e/` directory.
- Some database-related tests (e.g., checkout-flow) may be skipped due to ESM/Supabase issues.

### End-to-End Tests (Playwright)
- Start your dev server:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- In a separate terminal, run Playwright E2E tests:
  ```bash
  npx playwright test e2e/
  ```
- Playwright tests are not run by Jest and must be run separately.

### Troubleshooting
- If you see ESM import errors in Jest (e.g., in checkout-flow.test.tsx), these are due to ESM-only dependencies and can be skipped if not testing database flows.
- Only one Jest config is used (`jest.config.js`).
